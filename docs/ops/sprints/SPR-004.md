# Sprint SPR-004 — Audio Storage, STT/TTS & Voice Mode

End-to-end Audio/Object Storage, Speech-to-Text (STT), Text-to-Speech (TTS), and Voice Mode for chat. Includes S3-compatible storage with signed URLs, transcript persistence, and client/server wiring for microphone input and audio playback. Thorough testing, monitoring, documentation, and operational hygiene throughout.

## Status Summary

- Storage presign implemented: signed PUT (upload) and GET (download) in `ui/src/app/api/v1/storage/audio/presign/route.ts`
- Smoke tests added and passing locally (upload + download); S3 CORS setup script in `ui/scripts/s3-setup-cors.mjs`
- CI workflow added: Storage Smoke (LocalStack) at `.github/workflows/storage-smoke.yml`
- Local dev env finalized in `ui/.env.local` for LocalStack S3; Clerk disabled locally (`CLERK_ENABLED=0`)
- OpenAPI updated: `docs/api/core/openapi.json`
- Monitoring docs expanded: presign + transcripts + speech sections; metrics/log guidance
- Grafana: added dashboards `ui-api-storage-presign.json`, `ui-api-transcripts.json`, `ui-api-speech.json` and provisioning + Prometheus datasource; see `infra/monitoring/`
- Docker Compose: local Prometheus + Grafana stack with auto-provisioning (`infra/monitoring/docker-compose.yml`)
- Prometheus metrics: request counters/errors/durations are exposed and incrementing. Byte counters are implemented with labels `{route, method, status, mode}` — `coachup_ui_audio_bytes_in_total`, `coachup_ui_audio_bytes_out_total`, `coachup_ui_storage_bytes_uploaded_total`, `coachup_ui_storage_presign_bytes_planned_total` — and instrumentation is present in `ui/src/app/api/v1/stt/route.ts`, `ui/src/app/api/v1/tts/route.ts`, and `ui/src/app/api/v1/storage/audio/presign/route.ts`.
- Current anomaly: the above byte counters do not yet appear in `/api/metrics` output despite increments executing during smoke tests. Request-level metrics are visible. Suspect a registry/state exposure issue; investigation in progress.
- Smoke coverage: `ui/scripts/stt-multipart-smoke.mjs`, `ui/scripts/tts-smoke.mjs`, and `ui/scripts/storage-presign-smoke.mjs` exercise the code paths; structured logs confirm the `.inc()` calls ran. The absence appears isolated to exposition via `/api/metrics`.
- Decisions recorded: LocalStack defaults, presign policy (15m), privacy/logging rules
- STT/TTS provider resolver implemented with env-driven selection (`STT_PROVIDER`, `TTS_PROVIDER`, `SPEECH_PROFILE`) and optional per-request override (`ALLOW_PROVIDER_OVERRIDE`)
- STT (OpenAI mocked) supports fetching audio via S3 `objectKey`; TTS uploads synthesized audio to S3; unit and integration tests passing
- Next: Voice Mode end-to-end and client playback UX
- STT multipart/form-data upload path implemented: uploads file to S3, transcribes via provider, and persists transcript; unit + integration tests passing. Node/vitest `File` gap handled via duck-typed check in `ui/src/app/api/v1/stt/route.ts`.
- API docs updated for STT multipart: `docs/api/core/reference.md` includes `languageHint` for JSON and multipart; OpenAPI `STTRequest`/`STTMultipartRequest` include `languageHint` and `STTResponse` allows nullable ids/urls; `STT_MAX_AUDIO_BYTES` documented.
 - Convex dev deployment provisioned via `npx convex dev`; schema validated and synced from `convex/schema.ts` (includes `interactions.text`). `CONVEX_DEPLOYMENT` saved to `.env.local` (gitignored).

 - Chat LLM provider integration: `/api/chat` proxies to AI API `/chat/stream`, which is env-gated by `AI_CHAT_ENABLED` and provider selection via `AI_PROVIDER_CHAT`/`AI_PROVIDER`. Real streaming providers are not implemented yet in `coach-up-ai-api/app/providers/*` and the route currently falls back to a stub token stream. Full LLM integration is deferred to SPR-005. Env refs: `AI_CHAT_ENABLED` (default 0), `AI_CHAT_MODEL`, `AI_PROVIDER_CHAT=mock|google|openrouter`, plus `GOOGLE_API_KEY` or `OPENROUTER_API_KEY`.

## Verification (Local E2E)

- **Environment**
  - LocalStack S3 on `http://localhost:4566` with bucket `coachup-audio-local`
  - `ui/.env.local` configured: `STORAGE_PROVIDER=s3`, `S3_REGION=us-east-1`, `S3_FORCE_PATH_STYLE=1`, local AWS creds
  - Clerk disabled (`CLERK_ENABLED=0`)
- **Routes tested**
  - `POST /api/v1/storage/audio/presign` → presigned PUT URL returns 200 with `url`, `headers.Content-Type`, `expiresAt`, `objectKey`
  - `GET  /api/v1/storage/audio/presign?objectKey=...` → presigned GET URL returns 200 with `url`, `expiresAt`, `objectKey`
  - `POST /api/v1/stt` (multipart) → 200 with `provider=mock`, `languageHint` respected; audio uploaded to S3 and response includes `transcript`, `audioUrl`, `objectKey`
  - `POST /api/v1/stt` (JSON) → 200 using `audioUrl` path; response includes `transcript`, `audioUrl`
- **Smoke scripts**
  - Upload: `ui/scripts/storage-presign-smoke.mjs` (requests presign, performs PUT to S3 URL)
  - Download: `ui/scripts/storage-download-smoke.mjs` (ensures object exists, requests presign, performs GET)
  - STT (JSON): `ui/scripts/stt-smoke.mjs`
  - STT (multipart): `ui/scripts/stt-multipart-smoke.mjs`
- **Expected outcomes**
  - Both presign routes return 200; upload/download requests to presigned URLs succeed (200)
  - Metrics exposed at `/api/metrics` include series for `coachup_ui_api_requests_total`, `coachup_ui_api_request_errors_total`, `coachup_ui_api_request_duration_seconds` with labels `{route,method,status,mode}` where `mode=s3`
  - Byte counters expected: `coachup_ui_audio_bytes_in_total`, `coachup_ui_audio_bytes_out_total`, `coachup_ui_storage_bytes_uploaded_total`, `coachup_ui_storage_presign_bytes_planned_total` with labels `{route,method,status,mode}`. Status: implemented and incremented in code/smokes, but currently not present in `/api/metrics` output — see Issues & Deviations (2025-08-25).
  - Structured logs include `route`, `requestId`, `status`, `mode`, `latencyMs`
- **CORS**
  - Bucket CORS applied via `ui/scripts/s3-setup-cors.mjs` to allow browser PUT/GET during development

### Monitoring stack (local)

  docker compose -f infra/monitoring/docker-compose.yml up -d
  ```
- Prometheus: http://localhost:9090
- Grafana: http://localhost:3000 (admin/admin)
- Dashboards auto-loaded; datasource preconfigured. Adjust `prometheus.yml.sample` target host if needed on Linux.

  - `ui/src/app/api/v1/transcripts/route.ts` (stub list, auth, validation, metrics, logs)
  - `ui/src/app/api/v1/stt/route.ts` (mock STT; auth toggle, CORS, metrics, logs; persists interaction when `sessionId`/`groupId` provided)
  - `ui/src/app/api/v1/tts/route.ts` (mock TTS; auth toggle, CORS, metrics, logs; persists assistant interaction when `sessionId`/`groupId` provided)
- OpenAPI updated in `docs/api/core/openapi.json` for both endpoints
- Env examples updated in root and `ui` `.env.example` with S3, STT/TTS, and guardrails

- 2025-08-23: Transcripts endpoint implemented in Next.js with auth gating toggle, validation, filtering by `sessionId`/`groupId`, `limit` and `cursor` support, Prometheus metrics, and CORS. Unit tests added and passing; mock Convex store used in tests via `MOCK_CONVEX=1`.

- 2025-08-23: LocalStack S3 enabled and storage smoke passed end-to-end. Presign PUT/GET return valid URLs; upload and download both 200; object visible in bucket. Presign route configured with `requestChecksumCalculation`/`responseChecksumValidation` = `WHEN_REQUIRED` for compatibility. Added `ui/docker-compose.local.yml` to spin up LocalStack.

- 2025-08-23: Monitoring stack: added Grafana dashboards for UI Storage Presign and Transcripts, plus Grafana provisioning and Prometheus datasource; Docker Compose stack for local Prometheus+Grafana under `infra/monitoring/`.

- 2025-08-23: STT/TTS: scaffolded `POST /api/v1/stt` and `POST /api/v1/tts` with mock providers, CORS, auth gating, metrics, and structured logs; interactions persisted to Convex when `sessionId`/`groupId` provided

- 2025-08-23: Smoke: added `ui/scripts/stt-smoke.mjs` and `ui/scripts/tts-smoke.mjs`; wired npm scripts `smoke:stt` and `smoke:tts`; local smokes passing against Next.js dev server

## API Endpoints (scaffolded)

- `POST /api/v1/storage/audio/presign`
  - File: `ui/src/app/api/v1/storage/audio/presign/route.ts`
  - Auth via `requireAuth()` (Clerk-gated when `CLERK_ENABLED=1`), CORS, metrics, structured logs
  - Current: uses AWS SDK v3 to presign when S3 is configured; falls back to mock payload otherwise
- `GET /api/v1/transcripts`
  - File: `ui/src/app/api/v1/transcripts/route.ts`
  - Auth via `requireAuth()`, pagination params (`sessionId` required; `groupId`, `limit`, `cursor` optional), metrics, logs
  - Current: returns transcript items derived from Convex `interactions` (or in-memory mock when `MOCK_CONVEX=1`), filtered by `sessionId`/`groupId`; supports `limit` and accepts `cursor` (placeholder; pagination cursor TBD); structured logs + metrics included
  - OpenAPI updated: `docs/api/core/openapi.json` includes both paths and schemas

- `POST /api/v1/stt`
  - File: `ui/src/app/api/v1/stt/route.ts`
  - Auth via `requireAuth()`, CORS, metrics, structured logs
  - Current: mock provider returns deterministic transcript; when `sessionId`/`groupId` are provided, appends a Convex interaction with `role=user` and `audioUrl` metadata (mock when `MOCK_CONVEX=1`)

- `POST /api/v1/tts`
  - File: `ui/src/app/api/v1/tts/route.ts`
  - Auth via `requireAuth()`, CORS, metrics, structured logs
  - Current: mock provider returns a fake `audioUrl`; when `sessionId`/`groupId` are provided, appends a Convex interaction with `role=assistant` and `audioUrl` metadata (mock when `MOCK_CONVEX=1`)

## Monitoring & Logs

- See `docs/ops/monitoring.md`:
  - Section 10: Audio Storage Presign API
  - Section 11: Transcripts API
  - Section 12: STT API
  - Section 13: TTS API
  - Section 14: Speech Alerting Rules (Prometheus)
  - Section 15: STT/TTS Troubleshooting Runbook
- Key metrics (service: next): `next.request.count`, `next.request.errors`, `next.request.latency_ms`
- Log fields: `requestId`, `route`, `status`, `latencyMs`, and whitelisted params only; never log raw IDs or credentials

## Decisions

- Dev storage: use LocalStack S3 by default for local development
  - Set `S3_ENDPOINT_URL=http://localhost:4566` and `S3_FORCE_PATH_STYLE=1`
  - Create bucket per env (e.g., `coachup-audio-local`, `coachup-audio-staging`, `coachup-audio-prod`)
  - Configure CORS to allow presigned PUT with required headers and GET for playback
- Presign policy
  - Expiration: 15 minutes
  - Allowed content types: `audio/webm`, `audio/mpeg`, `audio/wav`, `audio/mp4`
  - Enforce `contentLength` bounds (client-provided; server validates)
- Privacy & logging: never log raw object keys or credentials; log only whitelisted params and hashed IDs

## Next Milestones

- Harden S3 storage:
  - Bucket CORS for PUT/GET, lifecycle retention, optional SSE
  - Presign-GET for download: completed; add E2E download check
  - Add integration tests for presign + upload with LocalStack
- Wire transcripts data source
  - Define Convex schema/indexes; persist transcripts on STT completion
  - Back `GET /api/v1/transcripts` with real pagination
- Developer tooling
  - Add smoke scripts (presign → upload → transcripts) and npm tasks
  - Add curl/TS examples to `docs/api/core/reference.md`
- Observability
  - Add dashboards and basic alerts; wire metrics emission to routes/providers

## Open Questions

- STT/TTS defaults for dev: Whisper local vs OpenAI/Azure? Cost/latency trade-offs
- Audio formats to support beyond `webm/mp3/wav/m4a`; any transcoding needed server-side?
- Default retention for raw audio (7–30 days?) and transcripts (longer?)
- Allow unauthenticated presign in local only (`CLERK_ENABLED=0`) or always require auth?

## Test Plan (smoke)

- Presign
  - POST `/api/v1/storage/audio/presign` with `{ contentType, contentLength }` → 200 with URL + headers
- Upload (manual)
  - PUT the audio file to the returned presigned URL with required headers → 200/204
- Transcripts
  - GET `/api/v1/transcripts?sessionId=...&limit=25` → 200 with `items` array and pagination
- STT
  - POST `/api/v1/stt` with `{ audioUrl }` → 200 with `text`, `confidence`, `language` (mock provider)
- TTS
  - POST `/api/v1/tts` with `{ text }` → 200 with `audioUrl` (mock provider)
  - Browser playback verification to be added when real provider is integrated

## Scope
In scope
- Audio/Object Storage with signed URLs and retention
- STT and TTS integrations via pluggable providers
- Chat Voice Mode UX (mic capture to audio playback)
- Transcript persistence and retrieval APIs

Out of scope
- Provider benchmarking and model comparisons (SPR-007)
- Detailed analytics/dashboard polish (charts beyond MVP)

## Features in this Sprint
List feature IDs from Features CSV (pipe-separate multiple)
- [ ] FEAT-025 — Audio Object Storage (S3-Compatible) (infra)
- [x] FEAT-043 — STT Mic Capture & Submit (frontend)
- [x] FEAT-044 — STT Provider Integration (ai)
- [x] FEAT-045 — TTS Provider Integration (ai)
- [x] FEAT-016 — Voice TTS Playback (frontend)
- [x] FEAT-049 — Mock STT Path for E2E (qa)
 - [x] FEAT-048 — Voice Mode Guardrails (max utterance, concurrent mic) (infra)

## Acceptance Criteria
- [ ] `POST /api/v1/storage/audio/presign` returns valid signed PUT URL (mock + S3)
- [ ] Browser can record and upload audio, then receive transcript via STT
- [ ] Assistant replies rendered as audio via TTS; playback works across major browsers
- [ ] Transcripts retrievable by `sessionId`/`groupId`; pagination and limits enforced
- [ ] Metrics and dashboards in place for storage, STT, TTS; alerts on latency/errors
- [ ] Docs updated (API reference/OpenAPI/examples/runbooks); env vars documented

## Risks & Mitigations
- Risk: Browser codec incompatibilities (webm/mp3/aac) · Mitigation: accept multiple formats; detect/convert server-side when needed
- Risk: STT/TTS provider latency/cost variance · Mitigation: pluggable providers; timeouts, retries, and fallbacks
- Risk: S3 permissions or CORS misconfig · Mitigation: least-privilege IAM, automated bucket policy, and tested CORS rules

## Dependencies
- Depends on features/sprints: SPR-003 (auth/schema/transcript APIs)
- External: S3-compatible storage, chosen STT/TTS provider(s), Clerk (auth)

## Technical Details
### Database Models
- Collections/Tables impacted: Session, Interaction, Transcript (if separate), Assessment
- New/changed fields: `interactions.audioUrl?: string`, `interactions.text?: string`, `createdAt`
- Constraints/validation: audioUrl must be http(s); size/type checks; text length caps
- Indexes (read/write paths): by `sessionId`, `groupId`, `createdAt`
- Migrations: add fields/indexes; backfill NA
- Data retention: raw audio per privacy window (e.g., 7–30d); transcripts retained longer

### Algorithmic Details
- Approach: provider adapters for STT/TTS with uniform interface and error typing
- Rubric Version: NA
- Latency targets: STT p95 < 4s for 10s audio; TTS start < 800ms; upload PUT p95 < 1.5s

### Prompts & Rubrics
- NA

## QA & Testing
- [ ] Unit tests: presign route, schema validations, provider adapters (STT/TTS)
- [ ] Integration tests: upload → STT → transcript persist; text → TTS → playback
- [ ] E2E: voice chat happy path (mic permission → upload → transcript → reply → TTS)
- [ ] Load tests: parallel uploads and STT; sustained TTS playback without glitches
- [ ] Contract tests: API routes (presign, transcripts GET)

Current status: Playwright UI E2E 16 passed, 2 skipped; audio storage smoke tests added (local + CI) and passing

## Observability & SLOs
Targets (see Technical Overview §10)
- Realtime chat p95 TTFT < 1.2s; full-turn < 2.5s

Checkpoints
- [x] Dashboards built/linked: storage ops, STT/TTS latencies, upload sizes
 - [x] Alerts for storage failures/latency, STT/TTS error rates
 - [ ] Structured logs include requestId, userId, sessionId, content-type, object key

## CI & Automation

- OpenAPI lint (frontend): `.github/workflows/openapi-lint.yml`
- Monitoring validation (root): `.github/workflows/monitoring-validate.yml`
- Storage Smoke (LocalStack): `.github/workflows/storage-smoke.yml`
- Next: add route tests and smoke scripts to CI for presign/upload/transcripts

## Issues & Deviations
Use this section to log issues encountered during the sprint, how they were resolved, and any deviations from the plan.

- Date: <YYYY-MM-DD> — Issue: <short summary> — Impact: <scope/users/services>
  - Detection: <alert/log/user report>
  - Fix: <what changed> — PR: <link> — Owner: <name>
  - Follow-up: <test/monitoring/doc action>
- Deviation from plan: <what changed and why>

- Date: 2025-08-25 — Issue: Prometheus byte counters not appearing in `/api/metrics` — Impact: Storage/Audio dashboards miss byte-volume series (observability gap)
  - Detection: Manual checks of `/api/metrics` after running smoke tests (`smoke:stt:multipart`, `smoke:tts`, `smoke:storage:presign`). Request metrics are present and incrementing; the four byte counters are absent.
  - Investigation: Confirmed counters defined in `ui/src/app/api/lib/metrics.ts` and `.inc()` instrumentation in `ui/src/app/api/v1/stt/route.ts`, `ui/src/app/api/v1/tts/route.ts`, and `ui/src/app/api/v1/storage/audio/presign/route.ts`. Smoke logs show the increment paths executed. Hypothesis: registry singleton/state or hot-reload behavior is preventing exposure of these counters.
  - Fix: Pending. Actions underway — add targeted debug logs around counter increments; verify single shared `prom-client` Registry instance; add an isolated test route to increment/read a byte counter; restart server between runs to exclude stale state; confirm `promRegistry.metrics()` includes all registered counters in a minimal repro.
  - Follow-up: Add metrics smoke assertions to CI once resolved; finalize Grafana panels and alert rules for byte volumes; update monitoring docs/runbooks with root cause and verification steps.

 - 23/08/2025 STT/TTS: scaffolded `POST /api/v1/stt` and `POST /api/v1/tts` with mock providers, CORS, auth gating, metrics, and structured logs; interactions persisted to Convex when `sessionId`/`groupId` provided
 - 23/08/2025 Smoke: added `ui/scripts/stt-smoke.mjs` and `ui/scripts/tts-smoke.mjs`; wired npm scripts `smoke:stt` and `smoke:tts`; local smokes passing against Next.js dev server
 - 23/08/2025 Docs/OpenAPI: STT multipart/form-data upload documented incl. `languageHint`; JSON example updated; OpenAPI aligned (`STTRequest`/`STTMultipartRequest` languageHint, `STTResponse` nullable fields); `STT_MAX_AUDIO_BYTES` added to env docs
 - 24/08/2025 Smoke: added multipart STT smoke script `ui/scripts/stt-multipart-smoke.mjs` and npm task `smoke:stt:multipart`; updated Verification with multipart + JSON STT paths
