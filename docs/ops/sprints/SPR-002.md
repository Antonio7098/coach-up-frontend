# Sprint SPR-002 — Assessments v1

Implement Assessments v1: Convex data model, multi-turn assessment pipeline with rubric v1, and end-of-session summary generation + UI display.

## Meta
- Sprint ID: SPR-002
- Status: complete
- Start date: 19/08/2025
- End date: 21/08/2025
- Links: [Overview](./overview.md) · [PRD](../../planning/prd.md) · [Technical Overview](../../planning/technical-overview.md) · [Monitoring](../../ops/monitoring.md) · [Benchmarking](../../ops/benchmarking.md) · [Features CSV](../features.csv)

## Objectives (Tick when achieved)
- [x] Assessment Data Model v1 in Convex with indexes
- [x] Multi-turn assessment job (buffering + triggers)
- [x] Rubric v1 implemented and versioned
- [x] End-of-session summary generated and rendered in UI

Note: Rubric v1 is currently deterministic and slice-based in the AI API; LLM-based scoring is deferred. Summary persistence in Convex is deferred to FEAT-032; the UI renders summaries fetched from the AI API.

## Planned Tasks
- [x] Assessment Data Model — (1d)
   - [x] Schema, indexes, validation rules in Convex
   - [x] Read/write functions + types
- [x] Multi-turn Assessment Job — completed for v1 (follow-ups below)
   - [x] LLM Boundary Classifier integration (LLM-first; thresholds; caching by `messageId`)
   - [x] Message ingestion endpoint (`POST /messages/ingest`) + per-session in-memory state machine (idempotent by `messageId`)
   - [x] Grouping lifecycle: create/attach/finalize `groupId`; handle one-off assessments
   - [x] Enqueue to Assessment Agent with idempotency key `(sessionId, groupId)`; retries/backoff; concurrency limits — enqueue + retries/backoff + concurrency implemented
   - [x] Observability: decisions/confidences, queue depth, job latencies, cost metrics — decisions/confidences + latencies + queue depth logged; cost pending
   - [ ] Phase 2 (follow-ups): Durable queue (FEAT-031), Convex session state & event log (FEAT-032)
      - Status: SQS FIFO integrated behind feature flag (`USE_SQS`); adapter + worker implemented; unit tests (enqueue, ack/nack, visibility backoff) passing; docs updated (config + LocalStack)
      - Next steps
        - Decision: Amazon SQS FIFO
        - Queue config: FIFO; MessageGroupId = `sessionId`; MessageDeduplicationId = `sessionId:groupId`; enable long polling
        - Delivery semantics: at-least-once with idempotency using `(sessionId, groupId)`
        - Retries/visibility: `visibilityTimeout` (e.g., 30s), exponential backoff via `ChangeMessageVisibility`; DLQ after N attempts
        - Producer: enqueue with attributes (MessageGroupId, DeduplicationId); payload includes `requestId`, `groupId`, `rubricVersion`
        - Consumer: worker polls SQS, processes message, `DeleteMessage` on success; on failure, do not delete to trigger retry
        - Convex integration: schema for session state and event log; write events on enqueue/claim/success/failure
        - Migration: feature flag to switch from in-memory to SQS; optional dual-write during rollout; backfill plan
        - Local dev: use LocalStack SQS; envs `AWS_REGION`, `AWS_ACCESS_KEY_ID`, `AWS_SECRET_ACCESS_KEY`, `AWS_SQS_QUEUE_URL`, `AWS_ENDPOINT_URL_SQS`
        - Makefile (AI API) provides helpers:
          - `make sqs-create-local` — creates FIFO queue `$(SQS_QUEUE_NAME)` and prints QueueUrl
          - `make sqs-list-local` — lists queues
          - `make sqs-purge-local` — purges messages
          - `make sqs-delete-local` — deletes queue
          - `make sqs-create-dlq-local` — creates FIFO DLQ derived from `$(SQS_QUEUE_NAME)`
          - `make sqs-attach-dlq-local` — attaches DLQ with `maxReceiveCount=5`
        - Usage:
          1. Start LocalStack (SQS) on http://localhost:4566
          2. In `coach-up-ai-api/`, run `make sqs-create-local`
          3. Copy the printed QueueUrl into `coach-up-ai-api/.env` as `AWS_SQS_QUEUE_URL=...`
          4. Set `USE_SQS=1`, `AWS_REGION=us-east-1`, `AWS_ACCESS_KEY_ID=test`, `AWS_SECRET_ACCESS_KEY=test`, `AWS_ENDPOINT_URL_SQS=http://localhost:4566`
          5. Optionally `make sqs-create-dlq-local && make sqs-attach-dlq-local`
          6. Start uvicorn and exercise endpoints; verify SQS metrics under `/metrics`
        - Metrics: instrumentation COMPLETE (SQS op timings, retry/visibility counts, assessment job durations, enqueue latency, in-memory queue depth); dashboards/alerts pending
        - DLQ: configure redrive policy; add alarms on dead-letter rate; redrive playbook
        - Rollout: enable `USE_SQS=1` in staging; monitor; then production rollout
- [ ] Rubric v1 — (~2d)
   - [x] Define categories, scoring buckets (RUBRIC_V1_CATEGORIES stubbed)
   - [x] Unit tests (determinism); metrics endpoint smoke test
   - [x] Golden cases
- [ ] Summary Generation & UI — (~2d)
   - [x] Generate session summary document
   - [x] Display in post-chat view (Assessments panel on /chat)

## Risks & Mitigations
- Risk: Over-triggering assessments · Mitigation: conservative heuristics + rate limits
- Risk: Rubric instability · Mitigation: lock rubric v1, add tests and versioning

## Dependencies
- Depends on features/sprints: SPR-001 (chat interactions exist)
- External: NA

## Technical Details
See design details in [Assessments v1 — Plan](../planning/assessments.md).
### Database Models
- Collections/Tables impacted: Assessment, Interaction, UserSession
- New/changed fields: Assessment.kind/category/score/errors/tags/groupId/rubricVersion
- Constraints/validation: kind/category combos; ids presence by kind; score ranges
- Indexes (read/write paths): Assessment by userId, sessionId, trackedSkillId, kind, createdAt, groupId
- Migrations: initial Assessment collection — Backfill plan: NA
- Data retention: Assessments retained; raw audio retention handled in storage sprint

### Architecture Layers
- Chatbot (SSE): streams assistant responses; emits a finalization event at end-of-turn. Assistant messages are only ingested after SSE finalization.
- LLM Boundary Classifier: lightweight model classifies each message as `start|continue|end|one_off|ignore|abstain` with `confidence`. LLM-first with heuristic fallback when confidence is low.
- Assessment Agent/Worker: consumes `{ sessionId, groupId }` on interaction end or one_off; computes rubric v1 scores and summary asynchronously.

### Algorithmic Details
- Approach: message-ingestion-driven, LLM-first boundary detection with heuristic fallback; per-session in-memory interaction state machine.
  - Endpoint: `POST /messages/ingest` (AI API) processes each incoming message `{ sessionId, messageId, role, content, ts?, flags? }`.
  - State: `state: idle|active`, `groupId` (active only), `turnCount`, `startedAt`, `lastMessageAt`.
  - Decisioning (LLM-first): classifier returns `{ decision, confidence }`; accept if `confidence >= 0.7` (env-configurable). If 0.4–0.7, apply fallback heuristics. If < 0.4, abstain → heuristics only. Cache per `messageId` to avoid re-billing.
  - Heuristics:
    - If `active`: decide end-of-interaction when any hold true: explicit flag `flags.endInteraction`, turn limit (default MAX_TURNS=6), inactivity (default INACTIVITY_MS=45000), or closing cues in assistant reply. On end → enqueue assessment for `groupId`.
    - If `idle`: either enqueue one-off assessment when `flags.requireAssessment` or start a new interaction when the user message indicates multi-step intent (question mark, length > MIN_LEN_CHARS=40, cue terms like “step/plan/walk me through”).
  - Queue: enqueue `{ sessionId, groupId }` to background worker (in-memory `asyncio.Queue`) → Assessment Agent (see section below) for rubric scoring and summary stub.
- Rubric Version: v1
- Latency targets: Background completion p95 < 8s

### Classifier Contract (LLM)
- Input context: last 4–6 turns, current message `{ role, content, ts }`, minimal metadata (`turnCount`, `elapsedMsSinceLast`).
- Output JSON (strict):
```json
{
  "decision": "start|continue|end|one_off|ignore|abstain",
  "confidence": 0.0,
  "reasons": "short rationale",
  "signals": ["closing_cue", "question_mark", "long_message"]
}
```
- Timing: user messages ingested immediately; assistant messages ingested only on SSE finalization.

#### Examples
- Example A — User message starts a new interaction

Request to `POST /messages/ingest`:
```json
{
  "sessionId": "sess_123",
  "messageId": "msg_u_001",
  "role": "user",
  "content": "Can you walk me through a plan to improve my backhand over the next two weeks?",
  "ts": 1692540000000
}
```

Classifier output:
```json
{
  "decision": "start",
  "confidence": 0.82,
  "reasons": "Multi-step intent with planning cue over a time window",
  "signals": ["plan", "time_window", "question_mark", "long_message"]
}
```

Server transition response:
```json
{
  "state": "active",
  "groupId": "grp_abc",
  "turnCount": 1
}
```

- Example B — Assistant finalizes and the interaction ends → enqueue assessment

Request to `POST /messages/ingest` (sent after SSE completes):
```json
{
  "sessionId": "sess_123",
  "messageId": "msg_a_002",
  "role": "assistant",
  "content": "Here is your two-week plan... Good luck! Let me know if you want any changes.",
  "ts": 1692540060000
}
```

Classifier output:
```json
{
  "decision": "end",
  "confidence": 0.74,
  "reasons": "Closing cues at end of multi-step response",
  "signals": ["closing_cue"]
}
```

Server transition response:
```json
{
  "state": "idle",
  "groupId": "grp_abc",
  "enqueued": true
}
```

### Assessment Agent
- Responsibilities: compute rubric v1 scores and generate an end-of-interaction summary for a `{ sessionId, groupId }`.
- Inputs:
  - Job payload: `{ sessionId, groupId }` (idempotency key)
  - Source of truth: fetch messages/events for the `groupId` (and metadata) from Convex
  - Optional: prior assessments for context and dedupe
- Outputs:
  - Assessment records (per rubric category + overall) persisted to Convex
  - Summary document persisted and retrievable by `sessionId`
  - Job result status with timings and cost metadata
- Idempotency & ordering:
  - One job per `(sessionId, groupId)`; drop duplicates
  - Reads are deterministic from persisted events; no dependency on in-memory buffers
- Retries & failures:
  - Retries with exponential backoff (e.g., 3 attempts) on transient errors
  - Poison handling: mark job failed with error and diagnostics after max attempts
- Batching & concurrency:
  - Process jobs FIFO; limit concurrency (e.g., WORKER_CONCURRENCY) to protect LLM rate limits
  - Optional micro-batching if provider supports it; otherwise per-job sequential LLM calls
- Observability:
  - Structured logs: `requestId, sessionId, groupId, rubricVersion, tokens, cost, latency`
  - Metrics: queue depth, p50/p95 latency, failure rate, retry rate, cost per job
- LLM usage:
  - Deterministicish scoring (temperature ≤ 0.2), rubric-aligned prompts
  - Provider-agnostic via abstraction; configurable model IDs via env

### Configuration & SLAs
- Classifier SLA: p95 latency < 300ms; cost budget per 1k messages (env: `CLASSIFIER_COST_BUDGET_PER_1K`).
- Env vars (examples):
  - `CLASSIFIER_CONF_ACCEPT=0.7`
  - `CLASSIFIER_CONF_LOW=0.4`
  - `MAX_TURNS=6`, `INACTIVITY_MS=45000`, `ASSESSMENT_COOLDOWN_MS=10000`
  - `WORKER_CONCURRENCY=2`
  - `DISABLE_CLASSIFIER=0|1`

### Idempotency & Ordering
- Require `messageId`; dedupe classifications and ingests by `messageId`.
- Prefer per-session monotonic `seq` for strict ordering; otherwise apply optimistic checks.
- Job idempotency key: `(sessionId, groupId)`; one assessment per pair.

### Privacy & Logging
- Redact message content in production logs; log metadata only.
- Include: `requestId, sessionId, groupId, classifier_prompt_version, rubricVersion, tokens, cost, latency`.

### Rollout Plan
- Shadow mode: run classifier without affecting state; compare with heuristics for N sessions.
- Feature flag to enable LLM-first: `DISABLE_CLASSIFIER=0` to turn on.

### Backpressure & Failure Handling
- Concurrency limits via `WORKER_CONCURRENCY`; retry with exponential backoff (e.g., 3 attempts).
- Poison queue handling: mark failed after max attempts; alert on thresholds.

### Prompts & Rubrics
- Prompt names/links: assessment-per-turn, assessment-multi-turn, summary
- Judge/rubric key points: correctness, clarity, minimality

## Current Backend Verification (21/08/2025)

Validated end-to-end for message ingestion → assessment enqueue → worker processing → summary fetch.

- __Key endpoints__
  - `POST /messages/ingest` — ingests user/assistant messages, classifies boundaries, updates session state
  - `GET  /assessments/{sessionId}` — returns latest `groupId` and summary (sync fallback if needed)
  - `GET  /service-metrics` — exposes lightweight service metrics
- __Structured log events to watch__
  - `messages_ingest` — decision/confidence and whether an assessment was enqueued
  - `assessments_enqueue` — enqueue confirmation with `queueDepth`
  - `assessments_dequeue` — worker claims a job
  - `assessments_job_start` / `assessments_scores` / `assessments_job_complete` — job lifecycle and timings
- __Known behavior__
  - SSE at `GET /chat/stream` is a stub that ends quickly; frontend EventSource “Network error” is expected in dev.
  - When classifier decides `start/continue`, we persist a placeholder summary and expose `latestGroupId` for fast polling.
  - When classifier decides `end` or `one_off`, we enqueue and also run one synchronous compute pass (when SQS is disabled) to make scores immediately available.
- __Quick verification__
  - Send a user message (`decision=start/continue`) then an assistant closing message (`decision=end`)
  - Tail logs for the events above and poll `GET /assessments/{sessionId}` — expect non-null `latestGroupId` and `summary.scores`.

## QA & Testing
- [x] Unit tests
  - Next.js API routes (ui)
    - `ui/src/app/api/assessments/run/route.ts` — file: `ui/tests/unit/api.assessments.run.spec.ts`
    - `ui/src/app/api/assessments/convex/[sessionId]/route.ts` — file: `ui/tests/unit/api.assessments.convex.get.spec.ts`
    - `ui/src/app/api/assessments/convex/finalize/route.ts` — file: `ui/tests/unit/api.assessments.convex.finalize.spec.ts`
  - UI SSR guard (ui)
    - `ui/src/app/chat/page.tsx` — file: `ui/tests/unit/ui.chat.ssr.spec.tsx` (guards against SSR-generated IDs and hydration mismatch)
  - Tools: Vitest (`ui/vitest.config.ts`), Convex client mocked
  - AI API (pytest)
    - `coach-up-ai-api/tests/test_assessments.py` — verifies background worker enqueue + result retrieval and 400 on missing `sessionId`
    - `coach-up-ai-api/tests/test_http_metrics.py::test_service_metrics_endpoint` — `/service-metrics` endpoint shape
    - `coach-up-ai-api/tests/test_persist.py` — persistence callback (no-op, payload, headers)
    - `coach-up-ai-api/tests/test_rubric_golden.py` — rubric v1 golden scores
- [x] Contract tests
  - Next.js ↔ FastAPI AI — passing
    - Endpoints: `POST /assessments/run`, `GET /assessments/{sessionId}`, `GET /chat/stream` (SSE)
    - Tests:
      - `ui/tests/e2e/api.contract.assessments.run.spec.ts`
      - `ui/tests/e2e/api.contract.assessments.get.spec.ts`
      - `ui/tests/e2e/api.contract.chat.sse.spec.ts`
      - `ui/tests/e2e/api.contract.messages.ingest.spec.ts` (validates user+assistant ingestion triggers assessment; GET returns non-null `latestGroupId` and `summary.scores`)
    - Runner: `ui/playwright.config.ts` with dual webServer setup (uvicorn + Next)
      - FastAPI (uvicorn): `python3 -m uvicorn app.main:app --host 127.0.0.1 --port 8000` (cwd `../../coach-up-ai-api`)
      - Next.js: `npm run dev:wasm` (fresh server per run; `reuseExistingServer=false`)
      - Next.js runs on `http://localhost:3100` (`PORT=3100`)
      - Env: `CSS_TRANSFORMER_WASM=1`, `AI_API_BASE_URL=http://127.0.0.1:8000`, `MOCK_CONVEX=1`, `PERSIST_ASSESSMENTS_SECRET` injected consistently for server and tests
      - In `MOCK_CONVEX=1` mode, the finalize route skips Authorization enforcement to prevent 401s in tests
  - Next.js ↔ Convex — added
    - Endpoints:
      - `POST /api/assessments/convex/finalize`
      - `GET  /api/assessments/convex/{sessionId}`
    - Tests:
      - `ui/tests/e2e/api.convex.persistence.spec.ts` (smoke)
      - `ui/tests/e2e/api.contract.assessments.convex.after-run.spec.ts` (contract; ties AI run → Convex baseline)
    - Notes:
      - E2E uses an in-memory Convex mock when `MOCK_CONVEX=1` to avoid requiring a Convex dev server in CI/local.
      - Real Convex runs are supported via a dedicated Playwright project: `chromium:real-convex`.
      - Run locally/CI with: `npm run test:e2e:real-convex`. Prefer setting `ui/.env.local` with `MOCK_CONVEX=0`, `CONVEX_URL`, `NEXT_PUBLIC_CONVEX_URL` (Playwright respects `.env.local` and only passes Convex envs when explicitly set).
      - Verified: 8 Playwright tests passed against real Convex (cloud dev), without inline env exports.
      - Quickstart added in `ui/README.md` under “Real Convex Quickstart”.
      - Status: Playwright E2E total 16 tests passing locally (contracts + UI + Convex mock)
- [x] E2E: complete a scenario and see summary (Playwright)
- [x] E2E smoke: home renders (Playwright)
    - Test: `ui/tests/e2e/home.spec.ts`
    - Runner config: `ui/playwright.config.ts`
      - `testDir: ./tests/e2e`
      - `webServer.env.CSS_TRANSFORMER_WASM=1` to force WASM Lightning CSS
    - UI E2E: `ui/tests/e2e/ui.chat.assessments.summary.spec.ts` (verifies Summary panel appears on /chat)
    - PostCSS config: `ui/postcss.config.mjs`
      - Uses plugin mapping shape: `plugins: { '@tailwindcss/postcss': {} }`
    - Lightning CSS (WASM path):
      - Dev dep: `lightningcss-wasm`
      - Shim: `node_modules/lightningcss/pkg/index.js` → `module.exports = require('lightningcss-wasm');`
      - Persisted via `ui/scripts/postinstall-lightningcss-wasm-shim.cjs` and `package.json#scripts.postinstall`
    - Local dev: `npm run dev:wasm`
    - Status: Unit tests (10) passed; Contract tests (3) passed; E2E smoke (1) passed; duplicate lockfile warning resolved (`ui/package-lock.json` removed; `ui/.npmrc` sets `package-lock=false`)
  - CI: Playwright E2E workflow (smoke + contracts)
    - File: `coach-up-frontend/.github/workflows/playwright-e2e.yml`
    - Smoke job: sets `SKIP_AI_CONTRACTS=1` to skip AI contract tests and run UI-only
    - Contracts job: runs dual servers via `ui/playwright.config.ts` webServer array (uvicorn + Next)
    - Toggle: `SKIP_AI_CONTRACTS` skips AI contract tests. In config, servers are conditional on `SKIP_AI_CONTRACTS` being `1|true`; tests themselves are skipped when the var is set.

## Issues & Deviations
Use this section to log issues encountered during the sprint, how they were resolved, and any deviations from the plan.

- Date: 19/08/2025 — Issue: Next.js API proxy JSON parsing caused 400 “Invalid JSON body” — Impact: UI proxy POST /api/assessments/run
  - Detection: curl tests to UI proxy returned 400
  - Fix: Switched proxy to forward raw request body and set X-Request-Id; added body pass-through handling
  - Follow-up: Validate POST end-to-end, add contract tests; ensure Content-Type preserved
- Date: 20/08/2025 — Issue: Upstream POST returned 422 JSON decode error; UI proxy intermittently 502/404 — Impact: End-to-end verification
  - Detection: curl against 127.0.0.1:8000 and UI proxy; logs show JSON decode error
  - Fix: Forward ArrayBuffer body and headers; confirmed upstream /health and GET summary OK; POST still under investigation
  - Follow-up: Force Content-Type header, explicitly re-encode body, and/or use request.clone().text(); consider defaulting proxy to 127.0.0.1:8000 during local dev
- Date: 20/08/2025 — Issue: OpenAPI lint failed due to missing tags — Impact: API documentation
  - Detection: OpenAPI lint check failed
  - Fix: Added missing tags to OpenAPI spec
  - Follow-up: Verify API documentation is updated correctly

- Date: 20/08/2025 — Issue: Next dev server failed due to missing native Lightning CSS binary — Impact: E2E blocked
  - Detection: Playwright webServer logs showed `Cannot find module '../pkg'` from `lightningcss/node/index.js`
  - Fix: Switched to WASM path — installed `lightningcss-wasm`, added shim at `node_modules/lightningcss/pkg/index.js`, set `CSS_TRANSFORMER_WASM=1` in `ui/playwright.config.ts`, updated PostCSS config mapping
  - Follow-up: Keep WASM for portability or switch to native binary in CI later

- Date: 20/08/2025 — Issue: Convex routes returned 502 (Bad Gateway) during real-convex E2E
  - Detection: Playwright `POST /api/assessments/convex/finalize`/`GET /api/assessments/convex/{sessionId}` intermittently 502
  - Root cause: `CONVEX_URL`/`NEXT_PUBLIC_CONVEX_URL` unset; Playwright webServer env clobbered `.env.local` by passing empty strings, defaulting Convex client to `http://127.0.0.1:3210` (no local server)
  - Fixes:
    - Provided valid cloud Convex URLs via `.env.local` (`MOCK_CONVEX=0`, `CONVEX_URL`, `NEXT_PUBLIC_CONVEX_URL`)
    - Updated `ui/playwright.config.ts` to only inject `CONVEX_URL`/`NEXT_PUBLIC_CONVEX_URL` when set, allowing Next.js to read `.env.local`
  - Outcome: Real Convex Playwright project passes (8/8). No further 502s observed
  - Follow-up: Add troubleshooting note: "502 from Convex routes usually indicates missing Convex URL or dev server not running"
- Date: 20/08/2025 — Issue: React hydration mismatch on `/chat` due to server/client `SESSION_ID` divergence — Impact: UI warning and unstable rendering
  - Detection: Hydration warning in DevTools; `SESSION_ID` generated at module scope with `crypto.randomUUID()`/`Math.random()` differing between SSR and client
  - Fix: Generate `sessionId` client-side in `useEffect`, persist in `sessionStorage` (`chatSessionId`), and gate UI actions until ready; aligned AI API base URL default to `http://127.0.0.1:8000`
  - Follow-up: Add regression test for non-deterministic SSR values in components rendering IDs (done); document pattern in UI README

- Date: 20/08/2025 — Issue: Cross-origin dev blocked (CORS) — Impact: IDE proxy/alternate origins could not call UI API routes (preflight failures; blocked POST/GET)
  - Detection: Network errors on OPTIONS preflight and blocked requests when opening UI via alternate origin
  - Fix: Added permissive CORS headers and OPTIONS handlers to UI API routes:
    - `ui/src/app/api/messages/ingest/route.ts` (POST, OPTIONS)
    - `ui/src/app/api/assessments/run/route.ts` (POST, OPTIONS)
    - `ui/src/app/api/assessments/[sessionId]/route.ts` (GET, OPTIONS)
  - Follow-up: Restrict origins for production; consider Next.js `experimental.allowedDevOrigins` for cleaner DX
