# Sprint SPR-003 — Auth & Data

Establish authentication with Clerk, baseline Convex schema, audio object storage, and session transcript storage to support MVP flows.

## Meta
- Sprint ID: SPR-003
- Status: planned
- Start date: <YYYY-MM-DD>
- End date: <YYYY-MM-DD>
- Links: [Overview](./overview.md) · [PRD](../../planning/prd.md) · [Technical Overview](../../planning/technical-overview.md) · [Monitoring](../../ops/monitoring.md) · [Benchmarking](../../ops/benchmarking.md) · [Features CSV](../features.csv)

## Objectives (Tick when achieved)
- [ ] Auth (Clerk) integrated and protecting routes/APIs
- [ ] Convex schema baseline created and type-safe
- [ ] Session transcript storage working (metadata + blobs)

## Planned Tasks
- [ ] Clerk Integration — <owner> (<estimate>)
   - [ ] Configure Clerk and protect app routes/API routes
   - [ ] Add user provisioning and local dev setup
- [ ] Convex Schema Setup — <owner> (<estimate>)
   - [ ] Define core tables (User, UserSession, Interaction)
   - [ ] Create indexes and types; add validation
- [ ] Audio/Object Storage — <owner> (<estimate>)
   - [ ] S3-compatible bucket, IAM/policy
   - [ ] Upload path conventions and signed URLs
- [ ] Session Transcript Storage — <owner> (<estimate>)
   - [ ] Persist interactions and metadata
   - [ ] Retrieval APIs for dashboard/summary

## Scope
In scope
- Auth gating, schema, object storage, transcript storage

Out of scope
- Detailed analytics/dashboard (SPR-005)
- Provider abstraction/benchmarking (SPR-006)

## Features in this Sprint
List feature IDs from Features CSV (pipe-separate multiple)
- [ ] FEAT-014 — Auth (Clerk) Integration (backend)
- [ ] FEAT-024 — Convex Schema Setup (backend)
- [ ] FEAT-025 — Audio Object Storage (S3-Compatible) (infra)
- [ ] FEAT-007 — Session Transcript Storage (backend)

## Acceptance Criteria
- [ ] Users can sign in and access protected areas
- [ ] Schema exists with indexes; basic CRUD validated
- [ ] Interactions stored and retrievable; audio objects persisted

## Risks & Mitigations
- Risk: Auth misconfiguration · Mitigation: dev/prod keys, test flows, runbook
- Risk: Data model churn · Mitigation: start minimal, evolve with migrations

## Dependencies
- Depends on features/sprints: NA
- External: Clerk, S3-compatible storage

## Technical Details
### Database Models
- Collections/Tables impacted: User, UserSession, Interaction
- New/changed fields: define minimal fields; add createdAt, userId indexes
- Constraints/validation: required fields; size limits
- Indexes (read/write paths): by userId, sessionId, createdAt
- Migrations: initial schema — Backfill plan: NA
- Data retention: audio objects per privacy window; transcripts retained

### Algorithmic Details
- Approach: none — structural sprint
- Rubric Version: NA
- Latency targets: API p95 < 500ms for storage ops

### Prompts & Rubrics
- NA

## QA & Testing
- [ ] Unit tests for Convex functions
- [ ] E2E: sign-in, create session, store interaction
- [ ] Upload/download smoke tests for audio
- [ ] Contract tests for protected API routes

## Observability & SLOs
Targets (see Technical Overview §10)
- Realtime chat p95 TTFT < 1.2s; full-turn < 2.5s
- Assessment p95 completion < 8s

Checkpoints
- [ ] Dashboards include auth errors and storage metrics
- [ ] Alerts on storage failures/latency
- [ ] Structured logs include requestId and userId

## Issues & Deviations
Use this section to log issues encountered during the sprint, how they were resolved, and any deviations from the plan.

- Date: <YYYY-MM-DD> — Issue: <short summary> — Impact: <scope/users/services>
  - Detection: <alert/log/user report>
  - Fix: <what changed> — PR: <link> — Owner: <name>
  - Follow-up: <test/monitoring/doc action>
- Deviation from plan: <what changed and why>

## Operational Hygiene
- [ ] CI checks green (API Docs workflow, tests/linting)
- [ ] Branch protection respected (PR + review)
- [ ] Pre-commit hooks executed (lint/format/type checks)
- [ ] .env.example updated if new env vars added
- [ ] Request ID propagated end-to-end for changed paths
- [ ] Logs include: requestId, route, userId (if available), provider, modelId, tokens, cost, latency
- [ ] Rate limiting and idempotency considered for new/changed endpoints

## Documentation
- [ ] API reference updated for endpoints touched (Core & AI)
- [ ] OpenAPI spec updated and linted
- [ ] Examples added/verified (curl + TypeScript)
- [ ] Cross-links updated (PRD/Technical Overview)

## Post-sprint
- [ ] KPIs reviewed; compare to targets
- [ ] Retrospective completed; action items filed
