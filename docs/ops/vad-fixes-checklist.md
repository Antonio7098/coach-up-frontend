# VAD (Voice Activity Detection) Fixes Checklist

## Overview
This document outlines the identified issues with VAD in coach-min and coach-debug, along with a prioritized checklist of fixes to improve first-word detection and silence handling after short utterances.

## Identified Issues

### 1. First Word Detection Problem - Excessive Debounce
**Location**: `MinimalMicContext.tsx` lines 262-264, 287-288

**Problem**: VAD requires 180ms of continuous speech (100ms minimum + 80ms debounce) before detection, missing short words and barge-ins.

### 2. Silence Detection Issues After Short Words
**Location**: `MinimalMicContext.tsx` lines 311-318, 313

**Problems**:
- Inconsistent silence thresholds (700ms vs 400ms for barge-in)
- Silence accumulator resets immediately on any speech detection
- Aggressive RMS downsampling (every 32nd sample) misses brief audio spikes

### 3. State Management Complexity
**Location**: Throughout `MinimalMicContext.tsx`

**Problems**:
- Multiple refs for tracking state create potential race conditions
- Complex interaction between barge-in logic and regular VAD

## Recommended Fixes Checklist

### 🔴 HIGH PRIORITY (Immediate Impact)

#### [x] Reduce Debounce Time for Faster Detection ✅ COMPLETED
- **File**: `MinimalMicContext.tsx`
- **Lines**: 262-264
- **Change**: Reduced `debounceMs` from 80ms to 30ms
- **Change**: Reduced `minSpeechMsBase` from 100ms to 80ms
- **Expected Impact**: Much more responsive to short words and barge-ins
- **Testing**: Verify "yes", "no", "hi", "ok" are detected reliably

#### [x] Improve Silence Detection Hysteresis ✅ COMPLETED
- **File**: `MinimalMicContext.tsx`
- **Lines**: 311-323
- **Change**: Added hysteresis to prevent premature silence detection
- **Change**: Only reset silence counter when speech exceeds threshold + hysteresis (0.005)
- **Expected Impact**: Prevents false silence detection after short words
- **Testing**: Speak short words and verify silence isn't detected immediately after

### 🟡 MEDIUM PRIORITY (Performance Optimization)

#### [ ] Optimize RMS Calculation Sampling
- **File**: `MinimalMicContext.tsx`
- **Lines**: 270-276
- **Change**: Reduce downsampling from every 32nd sample to every 8th sample
- **Expected Impact**: Better detection of brief audio spikes
- **Testing**: Test with very short utterances (<100ms)

#### [ ] Add Barge-in Specific Thresholds
- **File**: `MinimalMicContext.tsx`
- **Lines**: 291-305
- **Change**: Implement separate, lower thresholds for barge-in detection
- **Change**: Use `bargeInThreshold = speechThreshold * 0.8`
- **Change**: Use `bargeInMinFrames = 3` for faster barge-in detection
- **Expected Impact**: More responsive barge-in behavior
- **Testing**: Test barge-ins at different playback volumes

### 🟢 LOW PRIORITY (Advanced Features)

#### [ ] Add Adaptive Thresholds
- **File**: `MinimalMicContext.tsx`
- **Change**: Implement dynamic threshold adjustment based on ambient noise

- **Testing**: Test in quiet room vs noisy environment

#### [ ] Add VAD Calibration Phase
- **File**: `MinimalMicContext.tsx`
- **Change**: Add initial calibration to determine optimal thresholds
- **Change**: Record ambient noise for 1 second on startup
- **Change**: Store calibration data in localStorage
- **Expected Impact**: Personalized VAD tuning per user/environment
- **Testing**: Compare VAD performance before/after calibration

#### [ ] Improve State Management
- **File**: `MinimalMicContext.tsx`
- **Change**: Consolidate multiple refs into single state object
- **Change**: Add state validation to prevent race conditions
- **Expected Impact**: More reliable VAD behavior
- **Testing**: Stress test with rapid barge-ins and state changes
